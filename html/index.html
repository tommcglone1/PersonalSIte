	<h2>--About Me--</h2>
	
    <p>After five years in the Army, beginning as a lower enlisted infantryman, trying out and becoming a scout sniper, and finally finishing as a Sergeant and Team Leader, I left the Army wanting to take my life in a different direction. I returned to Philadelphia to complete my Criminal Justice degree at Temple University, which I had already completed 2.5 years of before joining the Army, with the thought that I might take the LSAT and attempt to become a lawyer. After all, I was quite a way through the degree and Law School sounded like the challenge I was looking for. As I worked through the final semesters at Temple, I began researching what being a lawyer would be like and began talking to currently practicing lawyers. I concluded that it was not what I was looking for. I then thought I might like to be a nurse since I enjoyed working alongside medics in the Army. So, I became certified as an EMT and began volunteering while taking post-degree prerequisite science and anatomy courses at Temple. However, the more I volunteered the more I realized I did not enjoy this either.  <br><br>

	As I continued to take prerequisite nursing courses, I wasn't sure what I would do, so I decided to ask around about other avenues I could take. As chance would have it, the previous year my brother-in-law had opened a software startup called Restoration X, and I figured I would help him out and see what software was all about. My job at Restoration X was not overly technical, but it made me more curious about the world of software and gave me the idea that it might be something that I would enjoy as a career. I began coding in Python, writing simple hello worlds and addition and subtraction programs and I never looked back. Unfortunately, I didn't have the time or money (VA funding) to obtain another bachelor's degree in Computer Science, so I had to look for other options. I began researching ways to obtain software knowledge without a degree program and learned about coding boot camps and from there Skill Distillery the boot camp that I finally decided to attend. <br><br>

	As I started the course and began learning Java, I noticed that I enjoyed it more and more each day. Undoubtedly, it was one of the most difficult times in my life, not only intellectually but also emotionally and mentally, but I was enjoying it so much that I knew that I wasn't going to quit. As we moved through SQL, JDBC and into Spring MVC we finally began to see web pages come to life, and this is where I knew I had made the right decision. Although the process of learning JDBC and the MVC pattern was a bit excruciating, once I saw the code I was writing appear (and not cause a 400 or 500 error) I was thrilled. Moving into Spring Boot and JPA the development life cycle became easier and brought more excitement with the discoveries I was making. By the time we hit REST, JavaScript, and then Angular I felt completely prepared to tackle the final full-stack project. Of course, these new technologies brought other challenges with a new, but still similar, development cycle to learn, but at this point, the learning process had become much smoother and the ideas were coming to me in a much more straightforward way. I was, and still am, extremely proud of the final project my group created. Not only because of the functionality of the site itself, but also because of the short six day sprint that we did it in.<br><br>

	I cannot wait to go back and continue working on the projects I created throughout my time at Skill Distillery, but I also look forward to new opportunities and projects that the future will bring me!</p>
